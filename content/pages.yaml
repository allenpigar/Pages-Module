This American Integrity Insurance review will look at customer reviews and average premium to see how it compares. The goal is to help you come to your own conclusions about who the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance company</a> in Florida really is.</p>\n<p>American Integrity is a Florida-based insurance carrier founded in 2006 because the CEO felt there was a shortage of “sound home insurance choices in Florida.” This company maintains an A rating from Demotech and issues 2.42 percent of home insurance policies in the state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"americanintegrityinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">American Integrity Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>American Integrity Insurance has been in business for 14 years but only has 17 insurance reviews on <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/american-integrity-insurance-group-5a0483223929140e4d9bedbb\">Clearsurance</a> with an average score of 1.6 out of 5. More than 72 percent give a one-star rating. Most complaints revolve around the claims experience and responsiveness.</p>\n<p>Even though we are a younger company, we actively ask customers to tell us about their experience. To date, we have <a href=\"/reviews/\">1,500+ customer reviews</a>. More than 95 percent are 4 or 5 star reviews.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/american%20integrity%20average%20customer%20review.png?width=907&name=american%20integrity%20average%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Growth starts with customer feedback.

While paying more for insurance is expected these days in catastrophe-prone states, costs don't have to be outrageous. By pricing risk appropriately, we've been able to save homeowners a lot of money each year.</p>\n<p>For a new home valued at $300,000, Kin's average premium of $1,354 a year is <strong>13 percent less</strong> than American Integrity Insurance's at $1,526 a year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>American Integrity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,526</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>What you pay for homeowners insurance will vary based on your home's unique characteristics, location, and more.

It's when their service is actually being used – and put to the test.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as many Florida homeowners know, insurance companies have a reputation for underdelivering on the promise made by their coverage.</p>\n<p>Some American Integrity Insurance reviews cite a slow or disappointing claims experience, though there's not enough data to demonstrate whether these are trends or outlier cases.</p>\n<p>We go to great lengths to ensure a responsive, accurate, and helpful claims experience.

    body: "<h2 id=\"americantraditionsinsurancereviewalookattheconsumerdata\">American Traditions Insurance Review: A Look At the Consumer Data</h2>\n<p>You don't want to trust the protection of your home to just any insurer. Your home deserves the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance company</a>. This American Traditions Insurance review is intended to help you make informed decisions when shopping for coverage. We'll look at customer reviews and average premium in particular.</p>\n<p>This insurance carrier was founded in 2006 and approved to underwrite manufactured homes. In 2016, American Traditions Insurance merged with another Florida insurer, Modern USA Insurance Company, adding on homeowners and condo policies. The company has an A rating from Demotech demonstrating its financial strength and has a little more than 1 percent of the homeowners insurance market share in Florida.</p>\n<h2 id=\"americantraditionsinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">American Traditions Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=american+traditions+insurance+company+reviews&rlz=1C5AVSZ_enUS606US610&oq=american+traditions+insurance+company+reviews&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j69i64.7927j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x88c2e5efb0f48f45:0xddc2ba03ea91ca3e,1,,,\">Google reviews</a>, customers are pretty happy with American Traditions Insurance. The company has an average rating of 4.7 based on 24 reviews. Given that the company has been around since 2006, you might expect to see more reviews, though.</p>\n<p>Some of the positive reviews comment on pleasant people to work with and responsiveness during claims. Ironically, the negative reviews note a lack of responsiveness. All of these reviews were within the past three months, which suggests that customer satisfaction may depend on the representative.</p>\n<p>Many of the early reviews give a rating without a comment.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Kin has a 4.8 average rating based on more than 750 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a>. It's important to get feedback from our customers so we can keep improving. Unlike American Traditions Insurance, we respond to any negative review in hopes that we can find a way to rectify the situation and learn from it.</p>\n<p>Our reviews consistently cite an easy buying experience, saving money, getting expert help when needed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/american%20traditions%20average%20customer%20review.png?width=907&name=american%20traditions%20average%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Good reviews based on hundreds of customer experiences give a solid impression of a company's track record. A handful of reviews may not be a large enough sample size.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"americantraditionsinsuranceaveragepremium\">American Traditions Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Ask any homeowner in Florida and they will all agree: <a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida is expensive</a>. The state’s average premium is among the most expensive in the nation. Many homeowners fear it will only go up with each year’s storm season promising more claims.</p>\n<p>For a newly built home valued at $300,000, American Traditions' average premium in $2,314 – <strong>70 percent more expensive than Kin</strong> at $1,354.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>American Traditions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$2,314</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Homeowners premium is based on your home’s location, size, construction, and claims history. The only way to know for sure what you'll pay for coverage is to get a quote. For reference, all Kin policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"americantraditionsinsuranceclaims\">American Traditions Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Claims are where insurance companies demonstrate their ability to deliver on the promise of the policy. While not every claim will be approved – policies do have exclusions – being responsive to claims is important.</p>\n<p>Some American Traditions Insurance company reviews are critical of the claims process, but there's not enough data to suggest a trend.</p>\n<p>We believe a frustrating claims experience is avoidable. We've built the best possible claims process with technology that helps us assess and process claims faster. This gives customers answers sooner than later, which makes everyone happy.</p>\n<p>In addition to <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">reaching out to customers after a major storm</a>, we created the <a href=\"/claims/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to pairs policyholders with licensed, insured, and local contractors.

We'll explore real customer reviews and average premiums so you can decide who is the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best Florida home insurance company</a>.</p>\n<p>Anchor Insurance offers homeowners insurance in 12 states, mostly along the southern border of the United States. It has 0.59 percent of the Florida homeowners insurance market share. Along with home insurance, the company offers condo, renters, dwelling fire insurance, and more. Anchor Insurance has M, Moderate, rating from Demotech. In early 2020, reports noted the company may be acquired by larger, more solvent insurance carriers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anchorinsurancecustomerreviews\">Anchor Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Anchor Insurance doesn’t have reviews on Google, Clearsurance, or Trustpilot like many other insurance carriers. It does have an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau where it also has <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/saint-petersburg/profile/insurance-companies/anchor-property-and-casualty-insurance-company-0653-90215219\">16 reviews</a> and an average score of 1.5 stars. Reviews are critical of the claims experience after storms and a lack of technological proficiency.</p>\n<p>We have hundreds of <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> on both Google and Trustpilot, and they're overwhelmingly positive. We maintain a 4.8 average rating on Trustpilot with more than 800 reviews. We also encourages customers to leave reviews so we can see where we shine and where we can improve.</p>\n<p>Our customers consistently mention our professionalism and expertise. They also cite saving money and having a good claims experience. For us, these reviews demonstrate the hard work we put into training our team and creating a culture of problem solvers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/anchor%20average%20review%20score.png?width=907&name=anchor%20average%20review%20score.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Customer reviews show whether an insurance company lives up to its promises.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"anchorinsuranceaveragepremium\">Anchor Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>From the data we could access, Anchor Insurance homeowners insurance premiums are $1,554 a year for a $300,000 newly built home. Ours is $1,354 a year, about 14 percent cheaper.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Anchor's financial stability rating is only an M from Demotech, compared to our A rating.</p>\n<p>It's also worth remembering that average prices are for illustrative purposes only. To know what you'll pay for home insurance, you need to get a quote. This will accurately reflect all the factors that play into your policy's price, like your home's location and age, your claims history, and more.

We'll also explore average premium so you can make informed decisions when shopping for the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best homeowners insurance in Florida</a>.</p>\n<p>Avatar Insurance has less than one percent of the Florida market home insurance share and maintains an A, Exceptional, rating from Demotech. The company offers homeowners, condo, mobile home, and commercial insurance in Florida. The company states it aims to “treat our policyholders’ assets as if they were our own.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"avatarinsurancecustomerreviews\">Avatar Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Avatar Insurance has 782 reviews on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=avatar+insurance+review&rlz=1C5AVSZ_enUS606US610&oq=avatar+insurance+review&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.3199j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x88c2c4f15f066ceb:0x9cf5ff51b4fd685b,1,,,\">Google</a> and an average rating of 4.3 out of five stars. It's worth noting that not all reviews are from their customers, though. Agents who sell Avatar's policies also leave reviews about their experience working with the company. Customers overall seem pleased with their speedy, professional service. The few critical reviews involve claims and cancellations.</p>\n<p>Avatar Insurance does seem to respond to negative complaints as of this writing.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Kin has more than 800 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> on Trustpilot, averaging 4.8 stars out of five.

Though you can't change the weather – or the hurricanes and floods that cause rates to spike – you can shop around for better prices. Even small savings add up.</p>\n<p>For example, our average premium for a $300,000 newly built home is $1,354 a year. That's 13 percent cheaper than Avatar Insurance at $1,535 a year.</p>\n<p>Remember, average prices are just meant to give you a ballpark of what your coverage may cost. The only way to truly know what you'll pay for your policy is to get a quote. Your costs depend on where you live, the age and construction of your home, and more. You may save even more if you qualify for additional <a href=\"/blog/3-products-that-lower-homeowners-insurance/\">home safety discounts</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Avatar</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,535</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"avatarinsuranceclaims\">Avatar Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Several Avatar Insurance reviews were critical of the claims experience.

We use technology to quickly assess damage and settle claims. We also created the <a href=\"/claims/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to pair claimants with local and licensed contractors.

    body: "<h2 id=\"bankersinsurancereviewwhatthedatasays\">Bankers Insurance Review: What the Data Says</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance companies</a> combine low prices with great service. But how do you know if a company follows through on those promises? This Bankers Insurance review aims to offer some insight. We'll take a look at customer reviews and average premium so you can make informed choices when shopping for coverage.</p>\n<p>Bankers Insurance has been around since 1976, meaning it has experience handling hurricane seasons. It's headquartered in St. Petersburg and has 0.29 percent of the Florida home insurance market share. This carrier offers homeowners, condo, renters, flood, and dwelling fire insurance, as well as commercial property insurance. Bankers Insurance maintains an A, Exceptional, rating from Demotech.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bankersinsurancecustomerreviews\">Bankers Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Bankers seems to solicit a lot of reviews on its own website, and those 595 reviews average a 4.5-star rating. Most of these reviews praise the agents and prices. On third-party review sites like <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/bankers-insurance-group-inc-5835ece073b103329e91ab6f\">Clearsurance</a>, the company only has 10 reviews with a 1.7-star score. These reviewers are largely critical of service and claims.</p>\n<p>Kin, on the other hand, has more than 1,500 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> on third-party sites like Google and Trustpilot, with an average rating of 4.8. Reviewers often compliment the ease with which they switched to Kin, how much money they saved, and the simplicity of our claims process. When we do get the rare critical review, we take to heart what customers say so we can learn and grow.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/bankers%20insurance%20customer%20review.png?width=907&name=bankers%20insurance%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Customer reviews on a neutral third-party site offer an unbiased look at the company's service.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"bankersinsuranceaveragepremium\">Bankers Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Florida is one of the most expensive states for homeowners insurance because of its catastrophe risk. Between hurricanes, floods, and sinkholes, homeowners face life-changing risks that their insurance must address. These severe risks have been driving insurance prices higher each year.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, some companies are working hard to keep prices affordable. Our average premium for a $300,000 newly built home is $1,354 a year. Bankers' is $1,678, about 24 percent more. You may qualify for even more discounts from Kin depending on your home's wind resilience, safety features, and more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium</th>\n<th>Bankers Average Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,678</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"bankersinsuranceclaims\">Bankers Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>The best insurance companies have the best claims process. That means fast, easy, and fair settlements, and as little burden on the homeowner as possible when it comes to repairs. That's our approach.</p>\n<p>We use technology to make it easy to report a loss, submit your claim, and inspect the damage. When possible, we use virtual inspections so claims adjusters start the process faster and settle claims faster. We also created the <a href=\"/claims/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to make it easy for policyholders to get their needed repairs done by insured, licensed, local professionals.</p>\n<p>While some reviewers cited a subpar claims experience with Bankers, we don't have much visibility into their process.</p>\n<p>See for yourself how Kin fares against Bankers Insurance.

You also want to work with a home insurance company that’s ready to help when you have a claim. This guide can help you find that company. We evaluated dozens of companies on several key factors, including cost, customer reviews, and Net Promoter Scores (NPS), so you can find the best home insurance for you.</p>\n<p>We’ve included ourselves in the analysis so you can see how our performance stacks up against some of the best homeowners insurance companies in the country. You’ll also find some tips on how to compare home insurance companies so you can make informed choices and pick the best <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">homeowners insurance</a> to protect your home and your family.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancecompanyratingspricecomparison\">Home insurance company ratings: Price comparison</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">Homeowners’ insurance costs</a> vary drastically from state to state and even county to county. So while looking at average premiums to get an idea of what you’ll pay for coverage, it doesn’t show anything specific to your situation.</p>\n<p>That said, below is an apples-to-apples cost comparison of the average annual premiums on a newly constructed home with $300,000 in <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> based on filings with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. This gives you a solid idea of who has the best rates in Florida - one of the most expensive places to buy home insurance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/average-fl-co-premium.png\" alt=\"Bar chart comparing average yearly premiums on a $300,000 newly built home for Kin and our top competitors.

Kin came in with the lowest rates in Florida at $1,316 per year on average. That makes us 15 percent less expensive than the next cheapest option (First Protective at $1,523 per year) and 68 percent cheaper than the most expensive option (Bankers Insurance at $2,222 a year).</p>\n<h2 id=\"bestandworsthomeownersinsurancecompanieshomeinsurancereviews\">Best and worst homeowners insurance companies: Home insurance reviews</h2>\n<p>While price is important, it’s not the only factor to consider when choosing the best home insurance company. Customer reviews can tell you a lot about a home insurance company, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How easy it is to get home insurance.</li>\n<li>Whether online quotes are available.</li>\n<li>How the company handles claims.</li>\n<li>How helpful and knowledgeable their team is.</li>\n<li>How they respond to complaints or issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You definitely want to read a handful of reviews to learn about the individual customer experience, but you can get an overall impression of customer satisfaction from review score averages.</p>\n<p>For all the homeowner’s insurance companies below, we took a look at online review sites (including Trustpilot, Google Reviews, and Clearsurance) that allow users to rank their experience on a scale of one to five.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fl-co-review.png\" alt=\"Bar chart comparing the average online customer review scores of Kin and several of its competitors.

Some companies like Bankers Insurance and Universal Property and Casualty Insurance have favorable ratings, but several of these home insurance companies fall far below even a mediocre customer experience. Many reviews for low-rated companies cited expensive premiums and a bad claims experience as the source of their dissatisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"besthomeownersinsurancecompaniesnpsscore\">Best homeowners insurance companies: NPS score</h2>\n<p>A Net Promoter Score indicates whether a customer is likely to recommend a company to a friend or family member. As you can imagine, that’s pretty valuable to an insurance company. A high score means a customer was so impressed with their experience that they’d trust the company to protect people they care about.</p>\n<p>The average NPS for the home insurance industry is 42 out of 100, a tragic score by any standard. That means folks are not impressed with their home insurance companies.</p>\n<p>Our NPS is 85 – more than double the industry average. The next national insurance company to come close to that score is USAA at 77.

This review looks at data from real customer reviews and average pricing data. You can see how this company compares directly to us based on these metrics.</p>\n<p>Capitol Preferred Insurance has been around since 1997. This company offers homeowners, renters, condo, dwelling fire, and life insurance. It maintains an A, Exceptional, rating with Demotech and has 0.42 percent of the home insurance market share in Florida, though they recently <a href=\"/blog/24k-fl-homeowners-losing-coverage/\">dropped many policyholders</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"capitolpreferredinsurancecustomerreviews\">Capitol Preferred Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Capitol Preferred Insurance has 58 reviews – you might expect to see more considering the company has been around for more than 20 years. It maintains a 2-star average rating on Google Reviews. Recent reviews cite cancellations and premium increases by 40 percent. To its credit, Capitol Preferred does respond to some reviews.</p>\n<p>Kin has more than 1,500 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> on Trustpilot with an average rating of 4.8 stars. Our feedback consistently cites our expert agents who are ready to help with any question or request.

While some reviews may be outliers, consistent remarks indicate a solid trend.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"capitolpreferredinsuranceaveragepremium\">Capitol Preferred Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>While Capitol Preferred Insurance fares better than some insurance companies in its reviews and complaints, its premiums may give some homeowners sticker shock. Capitol Preferred's average premiums are about double the price of Kin's. For example, for a $300,000 newly constructed home, their average yearly premium is $3,003. Ours is $1,354.</p>\n<p>Averages are a good way to give an impression of cost, but they aren't the whole story.

    body: "<h2 id=\"centauriinsurancereviewhowtocomparecarriers\">Centauri Insurance Review: How to Compare Carriers</h2>\n<p>To help in your search to find the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance</a>, we reviewed a bunch of Florida and Louisiana insurers, including Centauri Insurance. We took a look at online reviews from real customers and average pricing. Here's what we found.</p>\n<p>Centauri Insurance is a homeowners insurance carrier that offers both residential and commercial insurance. The company says it aims to “provide financial protection and peace of mind for our stakeholders.” The company's Demotech rating was <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2020/03/23/562072.htm\">recently under review</a> after terminating its acquisition by Avatar Insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"centauriinsurancecustomerreviews\">Centauri Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Centauri doesn’t have a lot of online reviews – only 44 are available on <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/centauri-insurance-co-59d3ad40d850aa5ef330f5cd\">Clearsurance</a> with a 2.3-star average rating. Positive reviews cite a good claims experience, getting a check within a week of a home estimate. Another review states their home was hit by lightning and the claims process was good. Negative reviews are critical of denied claims. The company does not appear to respond to reviews, good or bad.</p>\n<p>By contrast, we have more than 1,500 online <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> between Google and Trustpilot, with an average rating of 4.8. We ask customers to leave reviews so potential customers can learn from their experience (and we can, too!). This is how we learn and grow as a company: based on the feedback of the folks we insure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/centauri%20average%20review%20score.png?width=907&name=centauri%20average%20review%20score.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Customer reviews show potential customers what they can expect when they work with an insurance company.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"centauriinsuranceaveragepremium\">Centauri Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Florida and Louisiana are already known for their <a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">expensive premiums</a>, which is why prices matter for homeowners here. For a newly built $300,000 home, Centauri's average yearly premium is $2,724. That's almost double Kin's average at $1,354 a year.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these averages are illustrative only. The best way to find out what you'll pay for insurance? Get a quote. This will accurately reflect your home's risk based on your location, your claims history, and your home's unique features. It will also reflect the <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> you qualify for, which may bring your costs even lower.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium</th>\n<th>Centauri Average Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$2,724</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Louisiana</td>\n<td>$1,565</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"centauriinsuranceclaims\">Centauri Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Claims are where an insurance company shows their mettle – do they pay claims fairly and quickly? We can’t tell much about Centauri’s claims process from the reviews.</p>\n<p>For our end, we know that nothing is more frustrating than feeling left in the dark after filing a claim. That's why we prioritize communication, transparency, and technology in our approach to processing claims.</p>\n<p>We keep policyholders informed throughout their claim – our executives have even been known just to reach out and check in on folks!

You can use your dwelling insurance as a benchmark for how much property coverage to buy.</p>\n<p>For example, many homeowners opt to carry about 20 to 50 percent of their <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling insurance</a> for their belongings. So if your home is insured for $200,000, you'd likely want $40,000 to $100,000 in personal property coverage. If you have a lot of belongings, that percentage / amount of coverage may need to be higher.</p>\n<p>If you have really valuable belongings, like fine jewelry, art, furs, coin collections, wine collection, or antiques, you may want to look into <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduling these items</a>. Scheduling your property allows you to protect these items for the amount they're worth without drastically increasing your overall premium. There also isn't a deductible with scheduled personal property coverage. Nice little bonus, right?</p>\n<p>Give us a call at (855) 717-0022 if you want help scheduling your property today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeinventoriesboostyourpropertyprotection\">How Home Inventories Boost Your Property Protection</h2>\n<p>To figure out how much your belongings are worth, walk around your home and document the items that you invested in. Take photos of these belongings and file away your receipts. Doing so will help make sure you carry the right amount of coverage and help you if you need to file a claim to repair or replace these belongings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/5763266/checklist/personal-property-inventory-checklist.pdf\">Get your home inventory worksheet here</a>.</p>"

Chances are you had to line up a place to stay and pay to eat at restaurants or order takeout. If your trip was long enough, you likely had to handle other necessities, like going to the laundromat, etc.</p>\n<p>That's similar to what happens when you are forced to stay away from home while it's being repaired. So say your home is damaged by a fire, and you can't live there while repairs are underway. Coverage D in your home insurance policy can pay for additional living expenses, such as the cost of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Renting a place to stay</li>\n<li>Buying groceries</li>\n<li>Getting takeout</li>\n<li>Doing laundry</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whendoeslossofusecoveragekickin\">When Does Loss of Use Coverage Kick In?</h2>\n<p>To draw on your loss of use coverage, your home must be made uninhabitable by a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> your home insurance policy covers, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire</li>\n<li>Windstorm</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically, if your home is undamaged but you still can't access it because of a government mandate or a civil authority, this coverage won't kick in. An exception may happen if a civil authority prohibits the use of your home as a result of direct damage to neighboring premises. In those cases, you may be entitled to two weeks of additional living expenses coverage and/or fair rental value reimbursement.</p>\n<p>This coverage won't be effective if your home is uninhabitable because of <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood damage</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatispersonalliabilityinsurance\">What Is Personal Liability Insurance?</h2>\n<p>No matter how cautious you are, accidents happen and can be very costly. Personal liability insurance is the part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> that steps in when someone makes a claim or sues you over bodily harm or property loss you caused. It can help pay for things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The injured party's medical bills</li>\n<li>Repair costs for the person's damaged property</li>\n<li>Your legal expenses if the claim escalates into a lawsuit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So say, for example, your neighbor stops by to bring your mail that accidentally got delivered to their house. Let's also imagine it is raining hard that day, and unfortunately, your neighbor takes a nasty spill on your porch. Your poor neighbor ends up in the hospital after badly hurting their neck and back. They want you to pay $300,000 in damages accrued from missed work, surgery, and follow-up doctor visits.</p>\n<p>If you didn't have personal liability insurance to cover this massive cost, you might have to sell your house (and other assets) to settle the debt. But if you have at least $300,000 in personal liability insurance, you can make things right with your neighbor and not sell your property or deplete your savings.</p>\n<p>Think it won't happen to you? Consider this: according the <a href=\"https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/home-and-community-overview/introduction/\">National Safety Council (NSC)</a>, 38,300,000 people suffered nonfatal medically consulted injuries in homes in 2017.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoineedpersonalliabilitycoverage\">When Do I Need Personal Liability Coverage?</h2>\n<p>As a homeowner, your house is a major asset. It may be the biggest purchase you make your whole life. That also means if you have a home, you could lose it in a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>That's <a href=\"/blog/4-times-for-liability-insurance/\">why personal liability protection is so important</a>.</p>\n<p>You need liability coverage if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're a homeowner</li>\n<li>You regularly host parties or have guests over</li>\n<li>You have a pool or trampoline</li>\n<li>You volunteer / work with the community</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, it may even make sense for you to add extra liability protection by way of an <a href=\"/home-insurance/umbrella-insurance/\">umbrella policy</a>. This is a cost-effective way to drastically increase your liability coverage.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"cypressinsurancereviewhowtocomparecarriers\">Cypress Insurance Review: How to Compare Carriers</h2>\n<p>To help you better compare <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">Florida home insurance companies</a>, we've reviewed several insurers to see how they stack up to Kin. In this Cypress Insurance review, we'll look at what customers say about the company and average premiums.</p>\n<p>Cypress Insurance is a property and casualty insurance carrier that offers homeowners, rental, condo, rental property, and commercial insurance to residents in Florida and Texas. It maintains 0.53 percent of the Florida home insurance market share and has received an A, Exceptional, rating from Demotech.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cypressinsurancecustomerreviews\">Cypress Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Cypress Insurance only has 14 reviews on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5AVSZ_enUS606US610&sxsrf=ALeKk03CAyfvslROvVUhRE79EwAjaHmYXA%3A1590860741410&ei=xZvSXtW7GILr-gS9q6TgAg&q=cypress+insurance+&oq=cypress+insurance+&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgcIABAUEIcCMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgQIIxAnOggIABCDARCRAjoFCAAQkQJQr4_iA1jGruIDYI294gNoAHAAeACAAesCiAGqJ5IBBjItMTIuNpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiVsoOLktzpAhWCtZ4KHb0VCSwQ4dUDCAw&uact=5#lrd=0x88d902494bb7c331:0x9f836935f2bafef2,1,,,\">Google</a> and takes the time to respond to each. The company has an overall positive rating, with an average rating of 4.7 stars. The most recent reviews are all five-stars and note the company's great service. It seems they focus a good part of their business on commercial insurance because several reviews cite to business insurance.</p>\n<p>Like Cypress, Kin has an overwhelmingly positive <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a>. Unlike Cypress, we have hundreds more. In fact, between Google and Trustpilot, we have more than 1,000 reviews with a 4.8-star rating on average. We invite all our customers to leave public feedback so future customers can learn from their experience (and we can, too!). Most reviewers cite our expertise, our ability to save them money on their insurance, our easy claims process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cypress%20insurance%20averge%20review%20score.png?width=907&name=cypress%20insurance%20averge%20review%20score.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Customers are happy to leave feedback when you treat them like family.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"cypressinsuranceaveragepremium\">Cypress Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Because Florida is prone to catastrophic weather, its home insurance premiums are higher than most other states. Policies are priced to account for the expensive damage hurricanes, floods, and sinkholes can cause.</p>\n<p>That said, some insurers are more expensive than others. For example, Cypress Insurance's average premium for a newly built $300,000 home is $1,732 a year. That's nearly 28 percent more than Kin's at $1,354.</p>\n<p>While averages give you an overall impression of cost, they aren't exact. The best way to find out what you'll pay for insurance is to get a quote. Your costs depend on your location, your home's age, safety features, and more. You may qualify for more <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Cypress</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,732</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"cypressinsuranceclaims\">Cypress Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>We don't have much visibility into Cypress Insurance's claims process, so we won't weigh in.</p>\n<p>We can speak to our process, though.

This FedNat review will look at consumer data – from customer reviews to NAIC complaint scores – to shed some light on its strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>FedNat Home Insurance is a Florida home insurance company founded in 1992, and currently has about 4 percent of the market share. The company has an A rating from Demotech and offers homeowners insurance, condo insurance, flood insurance, and umbrella insurance. Let's see what their customers have to say.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fednatinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">FedNat Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Despite being in business for more than 25 years, FedNat only has few online reviews. According to the 15 reviews on <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/fednat-insurance-company-5a03274f074e915f4c098d5f\">Clearsurance</a>, 33 percent rated them excellent, 13 percent rated them good, and 53 percent rated them poor. Most of these reviews cite claims directly, which suggests a polarizing experience in the way claims are handled.</p>\n<p>Negative reviews mention adjusters who don’t accurately assess the damage. One in particular referred to a Hurricane Irma claim where the private adjuster noted the extent of the damage but FedNat ultimately denied the claim.</p>\n<p>By contrast, we have more than 1700 customer reviews on Trustpilot because we're eager to get feedback from our clients. We make a point to respond to reviews, particularly negative ones, to course correct as best as we can. While we can’t make everyone happy in every situation, we go above and beyond to try.</p>\n<p>Our customer reviews are an overwhelming positive. On average, our customers rate us 4.8 out of 5; FedNat's average at 2.6.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fednat%20average%20review%20score.png?width=907&name=fednat%20average%20review%20score.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Learning from feedback, good and bad, can help an insurance company continually improve.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"fednatinsurancevskinonaveragepremium\">FedNat Insurance vs. Kin on Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance has a reputation for being expensive in Florida. In fact, according to NAIC data, it is one of the top five most expensive states for homeowners insurance with <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">average home insurance costs</a> at $1,951.</p>\n<p>Though you might think you have to cut corners on your coverage to save on your policy, you don't. With an average yearly premiums of $1,354 for newly built home valued at $300,000, Kin's prices are far below other Florida carriers. Compare that to FedNat's average annual cost of $2,445. We end up being 80 percent cheaper without sacrificing coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>FedNat</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$2,445</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Of course, average give you a sense of what you might pay for home insurance, but the only way to know for sure is to get a quote. Your costs may vary depending on where you live, what discounts you qualify for, your home's characteristics, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fednatvskinonclaims\">FedNat vs. Kin on Claims</h2>\n<p>Claims are when a company really gets to prove the value of the insurance you've been paying for all this time. So it's telling when a company has a fair number of reviews that cite a disappointing claims experience.</p>\n<p>The FedNat mission to provide “fair, efficient, and personalized claims” seems to miss the mark with more than half of its reviewers. This suggests that the claims process is highly contingent on adjusters and claims reps who may not be trained to do things in the same fashion. Personalized becomes subjective and therefore inconsistent.</p>\n<p>That's why we work hard to create internal standards that every claims adjuster follows. We complement personalized service with technology (think drones, aerial footage, and satellite imagery) to streamline claims processing, particularly after a natural disaster. Our <a href=\"/claims/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> pairs policyholders with licensed, insured, and local contractors to get the work done professionally and fast. We also get in touch with our customers after a storm, regardless of whether or not they filed a claim. Bottom line: our policyholders are worth the extra effort.</p>\n<p>Curious about how Kin can improve the homeowners insurance experience for you?

You’ve probably seen firsthand the destruction a hurricane can cause an entire community. Protecting your mobile home is a must.</p>\n<p>But historically, mobile homeowners in Florida have been overlooked. Only a handful of insurers offer <a href=\"/home-insurance/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home coverage</a>, and when they do, the price is typically steep.</p>\n<p>We’re changing that. We <a href=\"https://medium.com/kin-insurance/oral-history-of-how-we-launched-mobile-home-insurance-42c624292f99\">developed our own Florida mobile home insurance</a> to be the best on the market. We designed our coverage to reflect your home’s actual risks, not a general assessment for the entire state. The result?</p>\n<p>The average homeowner who switches to Kin saves $500 a year (or more!). Our average premium for mobile home insurance in Florida is $894 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesfloridamobilehomeinsurancecover\">What Does Florida Mobile Home Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Florida mobile home insurance can cover more than just your home. A typical policy – without <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">added coverages</a> – usually covers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling</a>.</li>\n<li>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">belongings</a>, like your clothing, furniture, appliances, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other structures</a> on your property, like your garage, fence, shed, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of use</a> expenses when a covered claim forces you to temporarily relocate.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability</a> to help pay for legal expenses when you accidentally damage someone’s property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical expense payments</a> to help pay for small injuries guests experience on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The types of damage your policy covers depends on your insurer. But at Kin, our policies cover all risks except for those explicitly excluded by the policy. That means your mobile home has coverage for damage or losses caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Wind</li>\n<li>Hurricane and named-storm wind</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetinsuranceforoldermobilesinflorida\">How to Get Insurance for Older Mobiles in Florida</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-mobile-home/\">Mobile homes</a> – which is the term for homes built prior to 1976 – may have a more difficult time getting insured because they don’t adhere to the HUD Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. Homes built after 1976 are technically called manufactured homes, and they adhere to this federal building code that makes them safer and more durable.</p>\n<p>For a mobile home built after 1976, you can often get an online quote from Kin. For homes built prior to 1976, give us a call at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a> and we’ll help you find some coverage options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchismobilehomeinsuranceinflorida\">How Much Is Mobile Home Insurance in Florida?</h2>\n<p>The average cost of mobile home insurance in Florida is $894 a year from Kin. That said, your home’s location, the limits you choose, your home’s age, and other factors impact the cost of coverage.</p>\n<p>You can see how our prices compare to other Florida mobile home insurers below. These premiums are based on replacement cost coverage, not actual cash value policies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/average-fl-mobile-premium-by-company.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You can also see our average premiums by the county in Florida below.</p>\n<p>←<img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/average-mh-premium-county.png\" alt=\"average-mh-premium-county3\" title=\"average-mh-premium-county\" />→</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridamobilehomeinsurancediscounts\">Florida Mobile Home Insurance Discounts</h2>\n<p>You can save on your Florida mobile home insurance if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your mobile home is in a park.</li>\n<li>You have smart home protective devices, like a security alarm and water mitigation system.</li>\n<li>You are a homeowner who is 50 years or older.</li>\n<li>You’ve had continuous coverage for your home.</li>\n<li>You have a clean claims history.</li>\n<li>Your mobile home is your primary residence.</li>\n<li>You opt for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">Learn more about our discounts here</a>.</p>\n<p>And remember, you can adjust both your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">standard deductible</a> and your <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> for extra savings, too. Usually, the higher your deductible, the lower your premium – but make sure you don’t choose a deductible so high it prevents you from using your coverage when you need it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doyouneedmobilehomeinsuranceinflorida\">Do You Need Mobile Home Insurance in Florida?</h2>\n<p>Florida doesn’t legally require homeowners to have home insurance, but your lender might. If your home is in a mobile home community or park, your landlord may require you to have mobile home insurance, too.</p>\n<p>Even if you outright own your home and place it on private property, the extreme weather in Florida makes coverage a smart investment regardless. You never know when disaster will strike, and your coverage offers you the support to rebuild and recover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridamobilehomeinsurancequotes\">Florida Mobile Home Insurance Quotes</h2>\n<p>While mobile home insurance in Florida has a reputation for being unaffordable, remember that the insurer makes all the difference. While you shop around, look for a provider that offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Online quotes.</strong> With Kin, you can get a quote in minutes all online. We have a team of licensed insurance experts ready to help if you want personal guidance, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost coverage for the dwelling.</strong> Because manufactured homes depreciate in value quickly, it’s smart to have replacement cost coverage that can pay for what it would cost to replace your home, despite its depreciation, with a new, similar home. All Kin’s mobile home policies offer replacement cost coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Excellent customer service.</strong> <a href=\"/reviews/\">Read the reviews</a>! You want a company that has your back at any point in your policy – from quotes to claims.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"learnmoreaboutmobilehomeinsuranceinflorida\">Learn More about Mobile Home Insurance in Florida</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/clearwater/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/clearwater%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"clearwater mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"clearwatermobilehomeinsurance\">Clearwater Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/daytona-beach/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/mh%20daytona%20beach.jpg\" alt=\"mh daytona beach\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-1\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"daytonabeachmobilehomeinsurance\">Daytona Beach Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/fort-myers/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/fort-myers-mh.jpg\" alt=\"fort myers mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-2\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"fortmyersmobilehomeinsurance\">Fort Myers Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/gainesville/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/gainesville%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"gainesville mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-3\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"gainesvillemobilehomeinsurance\">Gainesville Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/jacksonville/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/jacksonville%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"jacksonville mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-4\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"jacksonvillemobilehomeinsurance\">Jacksonville Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/naples/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/naples%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"naples mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-5\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"naplesmobilehomeinsurance\">Naples Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/orlando/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/orlando%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"orlando mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-6\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"orlandomobilehomeinsurance\">Orlando Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/sarasota/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/sarasota%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"sarasota mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-7\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"sarasotamobilehomeinsurance\">Sarasota Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/st-petersburg/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/st.%20petersburg%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"st. petersburg mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-8\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"stpetersburgmobilehomeinsurance\">St. Petersburg Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/tallahassee/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tallahassee%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"tallahassee mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-9\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"tallahasseemobilehomeinsurance\">Tallahassee Mobile Home Insurance</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/florida/tampa/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tampa%20mh.jpg\" alt=\"tampa mh\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"-10\">#</h1>\n<h4 id=\"tampamobilehomeinsurance\">Tampa Mobile Home Insurance</h4>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"floridafamilyinsurancereviewwhatcustomerdatasays\">Florida Family Insurance Review: What Customer Data Says</h2>\n<p>In this Florida Family Insurance review, we'll take a look at what customers say about their experience. We'll also examine average premiums. The goal is to help you make informed decisions when shopping for the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance</a> in Florida.</p>\n<p>Florida Family Insurance was founded shortly after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The company has an A- rating from AM Best and an A' rating from Demotech. It offers homeowners, condo, rental property, and flood insurance, and has less than 1 percent of the Florida homeowners insurance market share.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridafamilyinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">Florida Family Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>It's surprising that Florida Family Insurance doesn't have more online customer reviews – it's been in business for nearly three decades. According to <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/florida-family-insurance-59663be33d8bd10440520fad\">Clearsurance</a>, it has an average rating of 2.32 based on only 15 reviews. Experiences seem to vary wildly: 33 percent give the company five stars and nearly 27 percent giving it one. The remaining reviews are evenly distributed.</p>\n<p>Positive reviews cite a good claims experiences – one reviewer had three claims with the company. Those who criticize the company cite high prices.</p>\n<p>No reviews mention how Florida Family Insurance handled claims after a hurricane. For a company that has been around as long as they have, you might expect to see some mention of hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Even though Kin is younger, it has more than 750 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> on Trustpilot alone with an average 4.8 rating. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with most customers citing an easy purchasing experience and saving money.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/florida%20family%20insurance%20customer%20review.png?width=907&name=florida%20family%20insurance%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Hundreds of customer reviews establish an overall trend in customer experience. A handful of reviews may mean customers aren't moved to write about their experience.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"floridafamilyinsuranceaveragepremium\">Florida Family Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>No one wants to pay more for home insurance than they have – and that's especially true for <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners</a>. The state faces some of the highest average premiums in the nation thanks to an annual storm season that seems to get more intense every year.</p>\n<p>With an average yearly premium of $1,354 for newly built homes valued at $300,000, Kin's prices are nearly 6 percent cheaper than Florida Family's average premium of $1,435 a year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Florida Family</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,435</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>All homeowners insurance premiums are based on individual home qualities that include replacement cost, location, age, construction, claims history, and more. Kin prices include <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a> to keep policy pricing simple and reliable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridafamilyinsuranceclaims\">Florida Family Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, insurance carriers are judged on how they handle claims. It doesn’t matter how great your customer service is during the buying process if claims are slow and inconsistent.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to say how Florida Family Insurance fares on claims because of the small sample of public reviews.</p>\n<p>Kin's approach to claims prioritizes communication, technology, and fast repairs. We get in touch with our customers after a storm just to check in. We use technology to streamline claims inspections. And we created our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to connect policyholders with licensed, insured, and local contractors so work gets done professionally and quickly.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for better home insurance, you've come to the right place.

    body: "<h2 id=\"floridapeninsulainsurancereviewwhattheconsumerdatasays\">Florida Peninsula Insurance Review: What the Consumer Data Says</h2>\n<p>This Florida Peninsula Insurance review offers a glimpse at how the company stacks up according to customer data. We'll look at customer reviews and premiums to give a sense of whether it's the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance company</a> for you.</p>\n<p>Florida Peninsula says it aims to be both “responsible and responsive” when it comes to insurance and claims. This insurance carrier has an A, exceptional rating from Demotech and holds 3.35 percent of the <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida's homeowners insurance</a> market share. A small slice of the Florida pie. The carrier sells homeowners, condo, renters, and flood insurance to Florida residents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridapeninsulainsurancescustomerreviews\">Florida Peninsula Insurance's Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Florida Peninsula Insurance maintains a 2.9 out of 5 stars on Google Reviews. The reviews are fairly mixed, but negative reviews often cite a poor claims experience or <a href=\"/blog/cancelled-homeowners-insurance/\">cancelled policies</a>. Most problems during the claims process seem to revolve around unresponsiveness. There seems to be little said, either positive or negative, about non-claims customer service and agent communications.</p>\n<p>For reference, our more than 730 Trustpilot <a href=\"/reviews/\">reviews</a> often cite an easy buying and claims process. More than 84 percent of those reviews noted their agents were professional, knowledgeable, and caring. Customers also say they saved considerably after switching. The reviews demonstrate that we want Florida policyholders to save money <em>and</em> get policies they understand.</p>\n<p>We're rated 4.8 out of 5 stars. You can see how we compare at a glance below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/florida%20peninsula%20average%20review%20score.png?width=907&name=florida%20peninsula%20average%20review%20score.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Changing home insurance starts with really listening to customers. Give them a policy that's affordable, easy to understand, and reliable at claims time.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"floridapeninsulainsuranceaveragepremium\">Florida Peninsula Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Every homeowner in Florida is trying to <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save money on homeowners insurance</a>. Thanks to its high hurricane exposure, the state has some of the highest insurance premiums in the nation, averaging $1,951 each year.</p>\n<p>Florida Peninsula, while not the most expensive insurer out there, is not super competitive for a regional insurance carrier. The average premium for a $300,000 new home is $2,557 per year – 88 percent higher than our average premium of $1,354 for the same type of home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Florida Peninsula</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,951</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Average premiums are illustrative only.

This is the time when a policy is supposed to deliver on its promise. Unfortunately, many Florida homeowners have been left disappointed.</p>\n<p>In Florida Peninsula Insurance's reviews, negative experiences seem to stem from a slow claims response. It's hard enough to deal with a loss and subsequent repairs. It's harder still to be left in the dark and not know what should happen next.</p>\n<p>That's why we rely on technology and transparency throughout the claims process. With virtual inspections and aerial imagery, we can assess damage quickly and process claims faster. Plus, we guide you through every part of the claims process and help you get repairs done quickly and professionally through the insured, licensed local contractors in our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a>.</p>\n<p>Ready to experience better homeowners insurance?

We'll explore customer reviews to get a sense of which <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">insurance companies are the best in Florida</a>.</p>\n<p>Heritage Insurance is based in Clearwater, Florida, and offers home, condo, rental property, and commercial insurance to Florida residents. A relatively small company with less than 4 percent of the Florida homeowners market share, it's publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and maintains an A, Exceptional rating from Demotech, Inc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heritageinsurancecustomerreviews\">Heritage Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Heritage Insurance doesn't seem to be requesting much policyholder feedback, despite the fact that customer reviews demonstrate a company's real life customer service.

Customers cite unexpected rate increases in their negative reviews. While <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">saving money on homeowners insurance</a> is the goal of every Florida homeowner, it's not all that matters in an insurance policy. You want a company that offers low prices and exceptional service.</p>\n<p>Heritage Insurance's average premium for a $300,000 new home is $1,757.

Many report saving more than $500 when they switched.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/homeowners%20choice%20review.png?width=907&name=homeowners%20choice%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Responsiveness and listening to customers are essential to great service.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownerschoiceinsuranceaveragepremium\">Homeowners Choice Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">Homeowners insurance in Florida is expensive</a>. The state is prone to serious hurricane and flood damage, and the price of homeowners insurance reflects that ever-increasing risk. But that doesn't mean you can't find affordable options.</p>\n<p>Premiums vary dramatically based on the value and age of you home, as well as its location. But to give you an example, we looked at statewide average costs for a $300,000 newly built home. Our average premium for such a home is $1,354 a year. Homeowners Choice is $2,979.</p>\n<p>That's <strong>112 percent more expensive</strong> than ours.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Homeowners Choice</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$2,979</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Keep in mind that average premium is just an illustration – the only way to know what you'll pay for coverage is to get a quote. It's worth noting that all Kin policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>. We know how important it is to keep your home properly protected for wind damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownerschoiceinsuranceclaims\">Homeowners Choice Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Ideally, an insurance company would shine at claims time. It's the first opportunity to deliver on the promise made by the policy. A customer pays premiums for years, and when they do experience a covered loss, they are right to expect good, fair service.</p>\n<p>But that starts with explaining the coverage appropriately when the policy is sold. When customers understand what losses are covered, there are fewer disappointments during claims. It’s also important to respond to claims quickly. Some customer reviews are critical of Homeowners Choice Insurance in that regard.</p>\n<p>Kin is committed to showing up for our customers, especially when they need us most. We check in on our customers before and after a storm. We use technology to assess losses quickly and streamline payments. We also keep policyholders informed throughout the process.</p>\n<p>We also want homeowners to be able to get their repairs done quickly and professionally. We established the <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to help customers choose a vetted contractor to handle their repairs. We only work with licensed, insured, local contractors with a track record for excellence.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how we can help you get more coverage for less.

It's our goal to help you make informed decisions as you search for the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance in Florida</a>.</p>\n<p>Olympus Insurance offers a variety of home insurance products, including homeowners, condo, townhome, and landlord insurance. It also offers scheduled personal property and flood insurance. The company maintains 1.46 percent of the Florida homeowners insurance market share and has an A, Exceptional, rating from Demotech. In December 2022, Olympus <a href=\"https://olympusinsurance.com/about-us/financials-and-stability-rating/\">earned a BBB+ rating</a> from Kroll Bond Rating Agency.</p>\n<h2 id=\"olympusinsurancecustomerreviews\">Olympus Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Olympus Insurance doesn’t have a lot of reviews for a company of its size - only 44 <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=olympus+insurance&rlz=1C5AVSZ_enUS606US610&oq=olpymus+insurn&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l7.4450j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x88ded557f0825e27:0x67387f6a852b7236,1,,,\">Google reviews</a> in total with an average rating of 3.7 stars. Positive reviews note good pricing and service. Recent negative reviews cite cancelled policies and denied claims. Olympus doesn't respond to many of its negative reviews.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Kin has nearly 800 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> on Trustpilot, averaging 4.8 stars. The majority are overwhelmingly positive, but in the rare case of a negative review, we respond quickly and try to find a good solution. We think these can be teaching moments. Most of our reviews acknowledge our expertise, ease, and savings. On average, we help our customers save $500 a year on their home insurance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/olympus%20insurance%20reviews.png?width=907&name=olympus%20insurance%20reviews.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Customer reviews are the best way to see how well a company lives up to its promises.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"olympusinsuranceaveragepremium\">Olympus Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Florida has some of the <a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">highest home insurance premiums in the country</a> because of its hurricane and flood risk. The bad news? Prices are on track to steadily increase each year as storms become more severe and frequent.</p>\n<p>Some insurers, like Kin, are working hard to bring prices down. For example, to insure a newly built $300,000 home, our average premium is about $1,354 a year. Olympus Insurance’s average annual premium is $1,428, <strong>5 percent</strong> <strong>more</strong> than Kin’s.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Olympus</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,428</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You’ll still need to get a quote to see how much we can save you.

Plus, you may qualify for more <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> and <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation credits</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"olympusinsuranceclaims\">Olympus Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Claims can be a real opportunity for an insurance company to demonstrate its value. Most customers pay for insurance for years without ever filing a claim. So when they need their company to be there for them, they rightfully expect good results.</p>\n<p>We can't speak to Olympus' claims process, and public reviews offer little insight beyond disappointment over denied claims after major hurricanes.</p>\n<p>We can speak to our process, though. We rely on both technology and good communication to ensure claims are settled fairly. We established the <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to help our customers easily connect with highly vetted, insured contractors to handle their repairs.

    body: "<p>If it seems like hurricanes are getting worse, you’re not imagining it.</p>\n<p>Oceans are heating up, and that heat is affecting when and how storms form, as well as how they behave. While scientific models offer mixed predictions about how warming oceans are likely to affect the total number of hurricanes, they point to a <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00539.1\">45 to 87 percent increase</a> in the number of Category 4 and Category 5 hurricanes – that is, those with the highest <a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php?\">wind speeds</a>, which tend to be most destructive.</p>\n<p>While hurricanes themselves are changing, the best ways to prepare are not. Here, we’ll outline how to prepare for a hurricane before hurricane season and right before a storm. You'll also find tips on what you can do after the storm to reduce damage and return to normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodobeforeahurricaneseasonalprep\">What to Do Before a Hurricane: Seasonal Prep</h2>\n<p>Hurricane preparation involves more than stashing a few gallons of water in the pantry and hoping for the best, so if you can, prepare well in advance of hurricane season.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1makeahurricaneevacuationplan\">1. Make a Hurricane Evacuation Plan</h3>\n<p>Most experts recommend making an evacuation plan before any actual hurricane is in the forecast. Acting early helps ensure that your plan is rational and well thought out, rather than an emotional response to the fear that a hurricane in the forecast can cause.</p>\n<p>Before you begin, make sure your <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/frequently-asked-questions-wireless-emergency-alerts\">Wireless Emergency Alerts</a> (WEAs) provided by the government are turned on, and <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/knowyourzone/\">check to see whether you’re in an evacuation zone</a> so you know ahead of time what to expect in the event of a storm.</p>\n<p>Make sure you evacuation plan outlines the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your evacuation route</strong>. Buy a relevant paper map in case digital communications are out when you have to evacuate.</li>\n<li><strong>Arrangements for where you’ll stay</strong>. This might mean making a primary plan to stay with friends or family who live out of the danger zone and a shelter fallback plan. If a storm is already looming and you can’t evacuate in time, have your <a href=\"https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/shelters/\">county’s shelter information</a> on hand. As you plan, don’t forget to accommodate your <a href=\"/blog/pet-insurance/\">pets</a>: remember that some shelters won’t take pets and that it’s best for yours to have all relevant paperwork with them (vaccination information, insurance documents, medical records, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>When you’ll evacuate</strong>. While it’s fine to wait until official channels issue an <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-mandatory-evacuation/\">evacuation order</a>, certain groups may wish to evacuate sooner to ensure they have plenty of time to get where they’re going. If you or someone you’ll be traveling with is elderly, has special needs, is pregnant, or is sick, you may want to plan an early evacuation to keep everyone safe. Those who live in mobile homes or low-lying coastal areas should generally evacuate early, and those who will be towing large vehicles may have to, as high winds can make driving these vehicles dangerous.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have a plan in place, communicate it with your household and any folks you plan to stay with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2gatherevacuationessentials\">2. Gather Evacuation Essentials</h3>\n<p>When you’ve planned how and when you’ll evacuate, it’s time to decide what you’ll bring. You can pack many of these items ahead of time, and it’s wise to do so to make the evacuation process as seamless as possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/FB-Hurricane-Evacuation-Essentials.png?width=940&name=FB-Hurricane-Evacuation-Essentials.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Prepare yourself to bring the following if you evacuate for a hurricane:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A photo ID</li>\n<li>Medical essentials (medicine, glasses, equipment, etc.)</li>\n<li>A flashlight and extra batteries</li>\n<li>A battery-operated portable radio</li>\n<li>Bottled water</li>\n<li>Non-perishable foods</li>\n<li>Spare clothing and shoes</li>\n<li>Blankets</li>\n<li>Toiletries</li>\n<li>Important papers (<a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a>, will, deed to your house, etc.)</li>\n<li>Contact information for loved ones, your doctor, and your insurance agent</li>\n<li>Cash and credit cards</li>\n<li>Extra gas for your car</li>\n<li>A first-aid kit</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">inventory of your belongings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3purchasehurricanesupplies\">3. Purchase Hurricane Supplies</h3>\n<p>Florida residents can prepare for a hurricane by purchasing without sales tax during the first week of hurricane season. (Learn about the <a href=\"https://floridarevenue.com/DisasterPrep/pages/default.aspx\">Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holiday</a>.) Most of the supplies you need will last at least a year, but it’s important to check on them to make sure you’re well equipped.</p>\n<p>These are the most important things to have stocked to prepare for hurricane season:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough water and canned food to last at least a week</li>\n<li>Flashlights or headlamps with a supply of extra batteries</li>\n<li>Candles and matches</li>\n<li>A whole-home generator</li>\n<li>Spare gasoline for your vehicles, generator, and any hand tools you might need for clearing fallen branches</li>\n<li>An ax in the attic in case there’s severe flooding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FEMA also offers some excellent <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit\">recommendations for building an emergency kit</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a generator and need to use it, don’t forget to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always operate the generator outdoors and away from open windows and doors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning or death.</li>\n<li>Always follow manufacturer's directions.</li>\n<li>Never try to power the house wiring by plugging the generator into a wall outlet, which runs the risk of electrocution.</li>\n<li>Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling to prevent ignition.</li>\n<li>Plug appliances directly into the generator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4reviewyourhomeinsurance\">4. Review Your Home Insurance</h3>\n<p>At the start of hurricane season, read over your insurance policy to know what it covers and what it doesn't. Keep in mind that once a storm has been deemed a threat to anywhere in your state, you may not be able to make changes to your policy.</p>\n<p>Remember that homeowners insurance usually doesn't cover flood damage. You need to add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for that protection.</p>\n<p>Also bear in mind that your <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> will apply for damage from hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>We mentioned above that you should have a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> of your belongings when you evacuate. This is mostly for insurance purposes: in the event of a disaster, pictures of your home and belongings can be vital for making insurance claims so you can replace your stuff and repair your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5getyourhomeready\">5. Get Your Home Ready</h3>\n<p>Brace your home for potential impact. You may want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Secure soffits.</strong> Install stainless steel screws through fascia to the soffit. Apply sealant over the screws and let it set for 72 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain your roof.</strong> Secure loose shingles, make sure they're properly sealed, and install flashing around your chimney and skylights. Wind speeds of Category 1 hurricanes range from 74 to 95 miles per hour, which can easily rip off poorly attached roof shingles. Category 5 hurricanes have wind speeds of 157 miles per hour or more, which can cause total roof loss. Taking care of your roof now can help you qualify for <a href=\"/blog/fl-wind-mitigation-breakdown/\">wind mitigation discounts</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Install</strong> <a href=\"/blog/best-hurricane-shutters/\"><strong>hurricane shutters</strong></a> <strong>to protect your windows from impact.</strong> Plywood should only be used as a last-minute effort because it doesn't offer as much protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Install a wind-rated garage door</strong> to withstand storm pressure. You can also temporarily reinforce your existing garage door with a brace.</li>\n<li><strong>Seal cracks and gaps around windows, doors, and other openings.</strong> Gaps that seem small in dry weather can be the source of lots of water and big problems during a hurricane.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure anything loose in your yard and store outdoor furniture,</strong> as high winds could send it flying. Ask your neighbors to do the same.</li>\n<li><strong>Trim tree branches</strong> that hang over your house or dying trees to prevent them from falling.</li>\n<li><strong>Back up your electronics to cloud storage</strong> and unplug your devices before a storm starts to prevent damage from electrical surges and power loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Put your refrigerator on the coldest setting</strong> to prepare for power outages and to protect your perishables.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"6prepareforfloodwaters\">6. Prepare for Floodwaters</h3>\n<p>Flooding is the most costly and common type of storm damage, so it’s important to take measures to reduce the potential destruction to your home and belongings, including these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store valuables and important documents above the ground floor in a waterproof container.</li>\n<li>Make sure your sump pump is working properly and has a backup power source (usually either from a battery or pressure from the municipal water supply). If you don’t have a sump pump, have one installed.</li>\n<li>Block doors with <a href=\"http://www.nwclimate.org/severe-weather/hurricane-preparation-guide/flood-protection/\">sandbags and plastic or urethane foam</a>. Neither method is perfect, but both can help block the main entryway water has to your house.</li>\n<li>Consider keeping an ax in the attic in case of severe flooding, but understand that axing your way out of the attic is difficult and dangerous. In addition to an ax, consider storing a red or orange flag and a pole you can raise it on, should you need to alert rescuers that you’re in need of help.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"lastminutehurricaneprep\">Last Minute Hurricane Prep</h2>\n<p>If a storm's imminently approaching and you haven't prepared in advance, make sure you secure your home immediately. You can do that by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Closing all exterior and interior doors and windows</strong>, including the garage door. Doing so can reduce wind force on the roof by up to 30 percent.</li>\n<li><strong>Making sure to charge your cell phone.</strong> SMS sometimes works after a storm when other methods of communication won't.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/about/news-multimedia/mobile-app-text-messages\"><strong>Downloading the free FEMA app</strong></a> to receive real-time weather alerts from the National Weather Service targeted to your county. The app also has emergency tips for each type of event and emergency shelter listings.</li>\n<li><strong>Tidying up outdoors</strong> by storing outdoor furniture, closing gates, securing fences, tying down any fixtures in the yard, and storing tools and equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Storing your insurance provider's contact information</strong> and family you might need to contact after the storm.</li>\n<li><strong>Putting hurricane shutters in place.</strong> Plywood should only be used in place of shutters as a last-minute resort when tropical weather is imminent.</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcing your garage door</strong> with a brace if it's not wind-rated.</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing gaps and cracks</strong> around windows, doors, pipes, electrical boxes, and vents.</li>\n<li><strong>Clearing debris from your gutters</strong> and extending downspouts away from your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Securing loose shingles on your roof</strong> with stainless steel screws and sealant.</li>\n<li><strong>Move valuables,</strong> important documents, electronics, and furnitures to the second floor.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoafterahurricane\">What to Do After a Hurricane</h2>\n<p>Even if you prepare for a hurricane perfectly, though, the storm might still cause damage. That’s just the nature of hurricanes.</p>\n<p>Once the storm itself has passed, you’ll be faced with the job of recovering and getting your life back to normal. Here’s how to do that as safely and efficiently as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t return until there’s an official all-clear</strong>. If you evacuated, wait until authorities say it’s safe to return. Coming back too soon could strain already shaky infrastructure and put you and your family in danger.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid flood waters</strong>. Whether you sheltered in place or evacuated, avoid wading and driving through floodwaters, which can contain debris and downed power lines.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat and drink with caution</strong>. Avoid drinking tap water until you’ve confirmed that it’s safe. Don’t eat refrigerated foods that were warmer than 40ºF for more than two hours. Emergency resources are likely to be constrained, so do everything in your power to avoid putting yourself in danger.</li>\n<li><strong>Wear protective gear when cleaning</strong>. After a flood, anything from falling branches to <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance/\">mold</a> could cause health problems, so proceed with caution as you clean up.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact your insurance provider</strong>. If your insurance provider hasn’t already reached out to you about coverage, reach out to communicate damage and start the process of filing claims. The sooner you do this, the sooner your home will be repaired.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more tips, check out the EPA’s guide to <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/hurricanes#recover\">recovering from a hurricane</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurricaneprepshouldbeanongoingproject\">Hurricane Prep Should Be an Ongoing Project</h2>\n<p>Obviously, there are a lot of variables when it comes to preparing for bad weather. The important takeaway here is that there is no single right way to prepare for a hurricane, but you do have to prepare.</p>\n<p>Maybe the easiest way to do this is to work hurricane preparation into your normal home maintenance tasks: whenever you test your smoke alarms, check the expiration dates on your hurricane food supplies and replace anything that’s gone bad.</p>\n<p>Whenever you clean the gutters, ensure your spare gas supply is adequate.</p>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>When hurricane preparation becomes part of your ordinary home maintenance, you’ll be better prepared to weather any storm that blows your way.</p>"

They have an average rating of 3.3 stars. Of the positive reviews, one notable five-star rating came after Hurricane Irma where the initial damage estimate was 25 percent less than the actual damage. Prepared worked with the adjuster to make sure the client was taken care of. The critical reviews mostly revolve around cancelled policies.</p>\n<p>To their credit, Prepared Insurance Company responds to recent negative reviews in an effort to learn how they can amend the situation.</p>\n<p>Kin actively solicits reviews because it is a valuable barometer of how we're doing. Kin's <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> average of 4.8 stars on Trustpilot based on nearly 800 reviews.</p>\n<p>Our reviews overwhelmingly note our professionalism, expertise, and kindness. Other reviewers cite how much money they saved by switching to us.

But how can you be sure you've found a good insurance company? What makes an insurer the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best insurance company</a>?</p>\n<p>This Safepoint Insurance review lays out the facts in an effort to answer these questions. We'll take a look at customer reviews and average premiums to give a full impression of the company so you can draw your own conclusions.</p>\n<p>Safepoint Insurance offers insurance in five states, including Florida and Louisiana. The company offers homeowners insurance, flood, identity theft protection, equipment breakdown, and commercial insurance. It has an A, Exceptional, rating from Demotech and maintains less than 1 percent of the Florida's home insurance market share.</p>\n<h2 id=\"safepointinsurancecustomerreviews\">Safepoint Insurance Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Customer reviews offer insight into what's it's like to work with a company. That's especially important when shopping for insurance because price is often not the only consideration. You want to make sure you're dealing with a company that will look out for you when you experience a major loss.</p>\n<p>Safepoint Insurance has strong reviews: out of 166 reviews, they have an average 4.1-star rating on Google. Many of the reviews cite good prices and service.</p>\n<p>The company also maintains an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau with 17 total complaints in the past three years – three of those complaints were resolved and closed. To the company’s credit, they do attempt to resolve the complaints with each consumer.</p>\n<p>For comparison, Kin has more than 1,800 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> between Google and Trustpilot and a 4.8-star average rating. Most of our reviews cite the excellent customer experience when buying a policy with us. Our staff knows the ins and outs of insurance, which means we're ready to answer any question. They also note saving quite a bit of money when they make the switch.</p>\n<p>Like Safepoint, Kin works hard to understand why someone didn’t give us top marks, responds to the issue, and seeks to find a solution when possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/safepoint%20insurance%20review.png?width=907&name=safepoint%20insurance%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Knowledge is power for homeowners.

Because of its intense and frequent hurricanes, insurers have to price coverage that appropriately addresses the risk to ensure they can pay claims. The best insurers constantly work to help bring down costs, though.</p>\n<p>Both Kin and Safepoint are similar in pricing. For a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> newly built home, our average yearly premium is $1,354, and Safepoint's is $1,348.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium</th>\n<th>Safepoint Average Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,348</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Louisiana</td>\n<td>$1,565</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Keep in mind that averages are an illustration, not a guarantee. Your premium will vary depending on where you live, your home's construction and age, your claims history, and more. Plus, you may be eligible for more <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> than those reflected in these projections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"safepointinsuranceclaims\">Safepoint Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>The point of insurance is to have financial security when you experience a loss. That's why it's so important to know how a company handles claims – this is when they make good on their promise to the policyholder.</p>\n<p>A few of Safepoint's reviews cite a disappointing claims experience, but overall customers seem satisfied.</p>\n<p>Our approach to claims is simple: we strive for clear communication, fair settlements, and quick repairs. We created our <a href=\"/claims/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to help you get your home back to its usual splendor faster.

    body: "<h2 id=\"findinghomeownersinsuranceinsarasotaflorida\">Finding Homeowners Insurance in Sarasota, Florida</h2>\n<p>Sarasota is a great place to lay down roots in Florida. Most residents own their homes, and the school districts are highly rated. While the cost of living in Sarasota is about nine percent higher than the Florida average, the trade-off is a small-town feel with all a big city offers.</p>\n<p>When comparing prices of homeowners insurance, Sarasota is less expensive than many other Florida cities – about $827 on average for Kin policyholders. While Sarasota is less prone to hurricanes than other southern and eastern beach cities, it still faces flood risk.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how to find affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance</a> for your Sarasota home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sarasotahomeinsurancecosts\">Sarasota Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Sarasota home insurance costs less than the Florida <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">average of $1,951 annually</a> (from all carriers) and the Kin average of $1,091 a year.</p>\n<p>Every home is different, which means every insurance policy is different, too. Any <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> added to the policy will ultimately impact your costs. For example, flood insurance can be added to policies, as can <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>The costs below illustrate average homeowners insurance costs in Sarasota (part of Sarasota County) between Kin and other insurance companies. These costs are meant to be illustrative only and are based on a standard policy (no extras).</p>\n<p>| Average Sarasota Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$968</td>\n<td>$2,479</td>\n<td>$2,928</td>\n<td>$2,739</td>\n<td>$3,370</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$668</td>\n<td>$1,378</td>\n<td>$1,330</td>\n<td>$1,372</td>\n<td>$2,078</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$846</td>\n<td>$2,602</td>\n<td>$2,598</td>\n<td>$2,445</td>\n<td>$3,782</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Every home is built differently. Your Kin quote will consider the size, age, and construction materials used in making your home. For older homes, you can see that investing in wind mitigation features, such as a reinforced roof, can potentially save you hundreds of dollars every year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sarasotahomeinsurancebasics\">Sarasota Home Insurance Basics</h2>\n<p>A basic home insurance policy still offers robust protection. When <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">buying homeowners insurance</a> in Sarasota, Florida, make sure yours includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost coverage</strong>: This is the total cost to rebuild your home from the foundation up after a covered loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal property coverage</strong>: This helps you replace or repair your belongings after a covered incident.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong>: When a covered claim forces you to temporarily relocate while your home is under repair, this can help you cover extra living expenses.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability</strong> <strong>coverage</strong>: This helps pay for settlements when someone sues you for damage or bodily harm you caused.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical payments</strong>: This is intended to cover small visitor injuries that happen on your property and help avoid lawsuits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your policy can easily be customized to meet your needs. Ask your Kin representative if additional coverages, like flood insurance, animal liability insurance, or <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled property insurance</a> makes sense for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringspecificrisksinsarasotaflorida\">Covering Specific Risks in Sarasota, Florida</h2>\n<p>Home insurance can cover losses from fire, wind, vandalism, and theft, which is a good thing considering Sarasota has one of the <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/sarasota/crime\">highest crime rates</a> in the state. Here are some other special coverage situations to keep in mind as you shop for coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sarasotahurricanecoverage\">Sarasota Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>Sarasota is vulnerable to storms from the Gulf of Mexico because of its location on the central western shore of Florida. While October usually sees the most hurricane activity, <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a> starts in June and ends in November. Sarasota and surrounding towns tend to avoid direct hits from storms like Hurricane Irma because the storms usually land south of the city and travel east.</p>\n<p>Even though Sarasota has been lucky in recent years, it still feels the effects of the storm. <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a> pays for claims resulting from the high winds of the storm. That’s why <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation measures</a> help reduce your insurance rate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sarasotafloodinsurance\">Sarasota Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Many Sarasota homeowners may be required to have flood insurance by their mortgage lenders. The barrier islands, shoreline, and homes along the canal have the highest risk of flooding.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much water for thousands of dollars of damage to be done. Even an inch of water can be disastrous for structures and personal property. Luckily, the <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">Kin Insurance flood endorsement</a> doesn’t have the same coverage restrictions and limits as NFIP policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageinsarasota\">Sinkhole Coverage in Sarasota</h3>\n<p>Aside from flooding and hurricane threats, Sarasota is home to a giant sinkhole called the Myakka Deep Hole, a popular but benign tourist attraction.</p>\n<p>Even though the eastern part of the state tends to have more sinkholes, Sarasota has its fair share. Geologists claim the sinkholes in the state are the result of heavy limestone concentrations that collapse when soaked and eroded over time.</p>\n<p>Sarasota residents who are concerned about sinkhole threats should be aware that Kin policies include <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringsarasotahomeownersinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Sarasota Homeowners Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Keeping costs down is important for any homeowner. That’s why Kin offers <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for homeowners who take steps to reduce their risk of losses.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can save on Sarasota homeowners insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protective devices</strong>: Install smoke alarms, security systems, and water mitigation devices to qualify for this credit.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind mitigation measures</strong>: Reinforced roofs, wind-resistant doors and windows, and hurricane shutters can lower your rates substantially.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure communities</strong>: If you reside in a gated community with or without guards, you can get an easy discount.</li>\n<li><strong>New construction</strong>: We know you can’t control the age of your home, but if it’s under six years of age, your rates may be lower.</li>\n<li><strong>Electronic policy</strong>: When you opt to manage your policy online, you get an easy discount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Discounts add up. Certified wind mitigation features can reduce an annual insurance premium on a $150,000 Sarasota home policy by $300, according to our data. That’s one-third the policy premium.</p>\n<p>Your Kin representative will review all discount opportunities and make sure you get reliable coverage at an affordable price. We’ll also review your policy each year to see if you’re eligible for any new discounts.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"securityfirstinsurancereviewwhattheconsumerdatasays\">Security First Insurance Review: What the Consumer Data Says</h2>\n<p>This Security First Insurance review will explore customer reviews from third-party platforms and complaints from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The goal is to give an impression of the company's customer service – both where it shines and where it could use some work. It's part of our ongoing quest to help you compare the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best insurance companies</a>.</p>\n<p>Security First Insurance is a Florida home insurer with 3.5 percent of the <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> market share. They have an A rating from Demotech, Inc. and offer homeowners, renters, condo, and landlord insurance. Let's see what customers say about their service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"securityfirstinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">Security First Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Security First Insurance maintains a 1.78 rating on <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/security-first-insurance-company-5835ece073b103329e91abaf\">Clearsurance</a>, an independent third-party review site. Of their 55 total customer reviews, only 25 percent give an excellent rating. More than 41 percent rate the company as fair or poor.</p>\n<p>By and large the negative reviews cite poor customer service and significant rate increases after renewal. Several have even accused the company of the “bait and switch” tactic: luring in homeowners with extremely good prices and then raising rates considerably.</p>\n<p>To Security First Insurance’s credit, they do respond to all negative reviews in an effort to find a solution.</p>\n<p>Florida is a notoriously difficult state for homeowners insurance. Insurers have to find a balance between pricing the policy to keep the company solvent if a widespread disaster hits and not pricing out homeowners. Most struggle with the latter.</p>\n<p>Of our 1,767 customer reviews on Trustpilot, our average score is 4.8. An overwhelming 84 percent of reviewers rate us five stars. Reviews cite our knowledgable agents, professional conduct, and swift claims processing. Only 4 percent of Kin reviews were a one-star rating, proof that we work hard to set the right expectations when helping our customers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/security%20first%20average%20customer%20review.png?width=907&name=security%20first%20average%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Working with customers to set expectations of claims turnaround times, rates increases, and more can create a better, more transparent customer experience.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"securityfirstinsurancevskinonaverageprice\">Security First Insurance vs. Kin on Average Price</h2>\n<p>Florida is one of the most expensive states for homeowners insurance with <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">average home insurance costs</a> of $1,951, according to NAIC data. And every year, prices steadily climb upward.</p>\n<p>That said, some rates are much better than others. For example, our average premium for a newly built home in Florida valued at $300,000 is $1,354. That's less than half Security First's average for the same home – $3,052.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$3,052</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>That said, home insurance average premiums give you an idea about price, but they're not a promise. The only way to know what you'll pay for coverage is to get a quote. Your costs may vary based on your exact location, your home's safety features, your claims history, and other factors. Plus, the <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> you're eligible for can also play a big role in your ultimate cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"securityfirstinsuranceclaims\">Security First Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>Claims show whether an insurance company delivers on the promise of the policy. Many of Security First's reviews cite a delayed claims, which can be a major burden on homeowners trying to get back on their feet after an unexpected loss.</p>\n<p>A good claims experience often boils down to two things: setting expectations about what damage is and isn't covered by the policy and having a system in place to process claims quickly and accurately.</p>\n<p>We go to great lengths to ensure we do both.</p>\n<p>We rely on technology like drone footage, virtual inspections, and aerial imagery to help us assess and process claims quickly and fairly. But we also know how stressful losses can be, so that's why personal service is a cornerstone of our process. We believe really listening is the best way to make sure our policyholders are heard and cared for.</p>\n<p>We also connect customers with licensed, insured contractors through our <a href=\"/claims/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to make sure their repairs get done fast and professionally.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for the best home insurance company – one with great rates and knowledgeable, compassionate agents – give us a call. We’ll be happy to see if we can save you $500 or more on homeowners insurance, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"homeinsurancecompanyreviews\">Home Insurance Company Reviews</h3>\n<p>Get a better look at how Kin compares to other Florida home insurance companies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/universal-property-casualty-insurance-review/\">Universal Property & Casualty Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/tower-hill-insurance-review/\">Tower Hill Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/florida-peninsula-insurance-review/\">Florida Peninsula Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/heritage-insurance-review/\">Heritage Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/upc-insurance-review/\">UPC Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/st-johns-insurance-review/\">St. Johns Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/american-integrity-insurance-review/\">American Integrity Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/peoples-trust-insurance-review/\">People's Trust Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/american-traditions-insurance-review/\">American Traditions Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/florida-family-insurance-review/\">Florida Family Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/southern-fidelity-insurance-review/\">Southern Fidelity Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/southern-oak-insurance-review/\">Southern Oak Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/homeowners-choice-insurance-review/\">Homeowners Choice Insurance Review</a></li>\n</ul>"

We'll look at customer reviews and premiums to give an objective impression of how Southern Fidelity fares when it comes to customer experience.</p>\n<p>Southern Fidelity Insurance was founded in 2005 and works with a series of independent agents in Panhandle states prone to hurricanes. It offers homeowners, condo, renters, flood, umbrella, and equipment breakdown coverage. The company has less than one percent of the Florida market share (0.81 percent) and has an A, Exceptional, rating from Demotech.</p>\n<h2 id=\"southernfidelityinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">Southern Fidelity Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Southern Fidelity Insurance doesn’t have a lot of customer reviews – only 27 on <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/southern-fidelity-insurance-company-59676d04a3fb611e4447f8b6\">Clearsurance</a> with an average rating of 2.72. Thirty percent of the reviews give a one-star rating.</p>\n<p>Reviews are sporadic – some are even years apart. Because consumers typically head to review sites when something is wrong, this could be a reassuring sign. It also mean few consumers are impressed enough to leave a review otherwise.</p>\n<p>Some reviews are critical of how claims were handled, while some positive reviews cite great service and quick claims processing.</p>\n<p>By contrast, we encourage customers to leave honest reviews. We want to learn from their experiences, both good and bad. Of the more than 1,500 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a>, our customers overwhelmingly give us five-stars. Our average rating is 4.8 on Trustpilot, with most policyholders citing an easy buying and claims process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/southern%20fidelity%20customer%20review.png?width=907&name=southern%20fidelity%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Encouraging customers to leave honest reviews demonstrates transparency.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"southernfidelityinsuranceaveragepremium\">Southern Fidelity Insurance Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Florida homeowners pay some of the <a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">highest home insurance premiums</a> in the nation, and rates are only projected to keep increasing as storms get more frequent and severe each year. It's important for homeowners to save money on their coverage without sacrificing coverage for hurricane winds and more.</p>\n<p>Southern Fidelity Insurance's average premium for a newly built home valued at $300,000 is $3,039 a year. That's more than twice as expensive as Kin's average of $1,354.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium</th>\n<th>Southern Fidelity Average Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$3,039</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Louisiana</td>\n<td>$1,565</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Averages are helpful, but to really see how much your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance will cost</a>, get a quote. It's the only way to crunch all the variables that impact your home's rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"southernfidelityinsuranceclaims\">Southern Fidelity Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>The claims process says everything about an insurance company. You can be the greatest at servicing policies, but if you don’t live up to expectations during a claim, you aren’t fulfilling the promise of the policy.</p>\n<p>Based on Southern Fidelity's customer reviews, it's not clear how the claims process is overall. Some negative reviews cite bad claims experiences, but it's not enough to get a sense of trend versus outlier experiences.</p>\n<p>What we do know for sure is how we approach claims: with transparency, speed, and ease. We keep you informed from the first notice of loss to settlement and repair. Plus, we leverage technology and virtual inspections to speed things up.</p>\n<p>We also offer our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to connect policyholders with licensed, insured, and local contractors who are vetted for their professionalism and quality of work.

The Florida Department of Financial Services is the <a href=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/default-source/rehab-and-liquidation_publicdocuments_files/557_CRT_20220228_OrderApprovingTransitionPlan.pdf\">court-appointed receiver</a>of St. Johns.</p>\n<p>This St. Johns Insurance review is based on information from third-party review sites. The goal is to see how the company fares compared to Kin on reviews, price, and claims. What does it take to truly be the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance</a> company?</p>\n<p>St. Johns states it promises policyholders a “high level of attentive, personal services, from experienced professionals who understand the issues homeowners face.” This carrier provides homeowners, condo, landlord, and personal umbrella insurance and writes 2.84 percent of Florida's home insurance policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stjohnsinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">St. Johns Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/st-johns-insurance-company-5980cd6d33ef680201e62be4\">Clearsurance</a>, St. Johns Insurance is rated 3.43 out of 5 based on a handful of reviews. Though the sample size is limited, St. Johns customers feel that the company offers “good insurance at a fair price” with friendly representatives. One five-star review was after Hurricane Irma and claimed that the roof damage was assessed quickly and that the claim was settled for “more than a fair amount.”</p>\n<p>Customers rate Kin 4.8 out of 5 based on <a href=\"/reviews/\">750+ reviews</a>, a substantial sample size that demonstrates consistent, across-the-board satisfaction. Our customer reviews note our professionalism, excellent customer service, and savings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/st%20johns%20average%20customer%20review.png?width=907&name=st%20johns%20average%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: A couple glowing reviews are nice compliments. Hundreds of them indicate a solid trend.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"stjohnsinsurancevskinonaveragepremium\">St. Johns Insurance vs. Kin on Average Premium</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> is the most expensive anywhere in the nation, thanks to repeated storms and catastrophe claims. That's why price is so important when homeowners shop for new coverage. Most are trying to find affordable coverage where they can.</p>\n<p>On price alone, St. Johns Insurance isn't as expensive as some Florida insurance companies, but it's no match for Kin. St. Johns Insurance average annual premium is $1,737, about 28 percent higher than Kin's for a $300,ooo newly built home. Our average is $1,354 – about $383 less a year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>St. Johns</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,737</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Your costs will vary based on your home's <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>, construction, age, and more. Your location also plays a considerable role in how much you'll pay for coverage.

Customers should feel confident their insurance company is in the fight with them, not against them.</p>\n<p>This is why Kin checks in with every policyholder after a major storm. In doing so, we are able to learn about damages faster for those who need us and touch base with those who don’t.</p>\n<p>Our commitment goes beyond just making a phone call. We invest in technology that helps assess and process claims faster than just about anyone in the business. We also created our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to help homeowners find reputable and local contractors to do repairs professionally and quickly.

    body: "<h2 id=\"findinghomeownersinsuranceintallahasseeflorida\">Finding Homeowners Insurance in Tallahassee, Florida</h2>\n<p>Though Tallahassee is Florida’s capital and home of Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University, it’s perhaps best known in the scientific community as the home of the world’s most powerful electron microscope. But you don’t have to be a science buff to appreciate living in Tallahassee. With a vibrant urban community, parks and gardens, and outdoor activities, there’s something for everyone.</p>\n<p>Yet homeowners here face nearly 60 inches of rainfall every year, meaning flooding is a real risk. Those seeking affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> can find it through Kin where our average rate in Tallahassee is $974 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tallahasseehomeinsurancecosts\">Tallahassee Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>The average homeowners insurance rate in Florida for all carriers combined is $1,951, making Florida one of the most expensive states for homeowners insurance. Kin is considerably more affordable with an average state-wide premium of $1,091 a year. In fact, homeowners in Tallahassee can get a policy that covers both standard perils and hurricanes for as little as $875 annually.</p>\n<p>That said, your policy’s price depends on the age, construction, size, and exact location of your home. Your personal property coverage and liability limits also impact the cost of your coverage.</p>\n<p>Comparing the cost of homeowners insurance in Tallahassee (part of Leon County), you see the costs vary widely between Kin and other insurance companies.</p>\n<p>| Average Tallahassee Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$929</td>\n<td>$1,171</td>\n<td>$983</td>\n<td>$1,357</td>\n<td>$1,856</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$875</td>\n<td>$1,063</td>\n<td>$579</td>\n<td>$934</td>\n<td>$1,574</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$1,118</td>\n<td>$1,371</td>\n<td>$1,068</td>\n<td>$1,653</td>\n<td>$2,650</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The chart shows that Kin is competitively priced. The rates also illustrate the savings policyholders experience when buying a newly built home or installing wind mitigation features.</p>\n<p>A newer home may be considerably cheaper to insure because new homes are built to meet stricter building codes to better withstand hurricanes. As you can see, a new home that is twice the value is just $200 more a year to insure.</p>\n<p>If your home has special features – like a swimming pool or <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">hurricane screen enclosure</a> – talk to your Kin representative and we can help you protect them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basicsoftallahasseehomeinsurance\">Basics of Tallahassee Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>If you’ve ever looked at your insurance policy’s declarations page and wondered what it all means, you’re not alone. Insurance has a reputation for being complicated, so let’s keep it simple.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">buying homeowners insurance</a> in Tallahassee, Florida, pay attention to the following on your declarations page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This is how much you have to rebuild your home to its pre-claim condition.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This helps you repair or rebuild other structures on your property, such as your garage, shed, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This is the total value of your personal belongings, such as clothing, electronics, appliances, your vinyl collection, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: This can help you pay for additional living expenses, like staying in a hotel, while your home is under repair for a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: This is how much your provider will pay toward a claim that you damaged someone’s property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: This is how much your provider will cover for “friendly injuries” on your property – i.e., someone needs medical attention but isn’t likely to sue you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, depending on your home and your needs, your policy may include additional coverages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringbigrisksintallahasseeflorida\">Covering Big Risks in Tallahassee, Florida</h2>\n<p>Tallahassee home insurance policies cover standard perils, such as fire, theft, and water damage caused by a pipe bursting. In Florida, we talk a lot about hurricanes and flooding, but crime in Tallahassee is high, too. Make sure you are covered for natural disasters and that your personal property is adequately covered for theft.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tallahasseehurricanecoverage\">Tallahassee Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>While storms that move up the eastern coast can hit Tallahassee, its biggest risk is from storms like Hurricane Michael that move northeast from the Florida Panhandle. Though many storms that make landfall to the east or south generally die down before reaching Tallahassee, the region is still prone to storms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a> pays for the damage caused by the high winds of a hurricane. The winds can destroy roofs or send tree branches and other debris through homes, causing thousands of dollars in damages. Kin policies include hurricane insurance, and homeowners can choose a hurricane deductible of $500 or 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent of the home’s replacement cost. This is separate from your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">standard home insurance deductible</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tallahasseefloodinsurance\">Tallahassee Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>There are four main waterways that cause flooding in Tallahassee: the West Drainage Ditch, the East Drainage Ditch, the Central Drainage Ditch, and the Northeast Drainage Ditch. This doesn’t mean other areas of the city are without flood risk, but these areas can be especially risky during heavy rains.</p>\n<p>Flooding in these areas is often just inches deep but can flood garages, basements, and street-level floors. Kin Insurance offers a <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood endorsement</a> to help homeowners deal with this type of risk and save money on flood coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageintallahassee\">Sinkhole Coverage in Tallahassee</h3>\n<p>Sinkholes can happen in any part of Florida due to the high concentration of limestone in the ground, but the <a href=\"https://sinkholemaps.com/resources/tallahassee-sinkholes-what-you-should-know-before-moving-to-tallahassee-fl/\">middle of Tallahassee</a> is especially susceptible to sinkholes. The swamplands erode limestone in the ground and lead to collapse.</p>\n<p>Sinkholes aren’t just in the remote part of the city; in 2014 and 2018 respectively, two sinkholes appeared in residents’ yards. Luckily, no one was hurt. Kin’s coverage for <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkholes</a> helps protect residents in areas where ground collapse is more common.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforkeepingtallahasseehomeinsurancecostsdown\">Tips for Keeping Tallahassee Home Insurance Costs Down</h2>\n<p>Even though Tallahassee home insurance is some of the least expensive homeowners insurance in the state, there are still things you can do to keep costs down. Saving even $300 every year adds up to thousands over the life of your mortgage.</p>\n<p>The following <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> are available for homeowners in Tallahassee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protective devices</strong>: Smoke alarms, security systems, and water mitigation systems</li>\n<li><strong>Wind mitigation measures</strong>: Impact-resistant doors and windows and reinforced roofing</li>\n<li><strong>Secure communities</strong>: Gated neighborhoods with or without guards</li>\n<li><strong>New construction</strong>: Homes under six years of age</li>\n<li><strong>Electronic policy</strong>: Online policy and account management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Kin representative will review these discounts to make sure you get every opportunity to save. Some discounts require documentation, so be prepared with your <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection report</a> and <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">security certificate</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"towerhillinsurancereviewwhattheconsumerdatasays\">Tower Hill Insurance Review: What the Consumer Data Says</h2>\n<p>This Tower Hill Insurance review will take a by-the-numbers approach at what to expect when buying <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> from Tower Hill versus Kin Insurance. We focus on public information provided by both consumer reviews and insurance industry data so that you can get a good sense of pricing, customer service, and claims handling to help you make informed decisions in your hunt for the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>A little background: Tower Hill Insurance started in 1972 and serves more than 1.7 million customers. This company is also known as the Omega Insurance Company and maintains a 5.96 percent market share of the Florida homeowners insurance market. The company sells insurance through some 850 independent insurance agencies in the state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"towerhillinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">Tower Hill Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>According toTower Hill Insurance's 103 reviews on <a href=\"https://clearsurance.com/insurance-reviews/tower-hill-insurance-5835ece073b103329e91abf9\">Clearsurance</a>, the customer experience is pretty polarized. More than 43 percent offer a five-star rating, 20 percent say their experience was fine, but nearly 36 percent offer fair and poor ratings. The negative reviews cite paying for policies for years and having claims denied.</p>\n<p>While no insurance company can expect 100 percent positive reviews all the time, review history gives a sense of what the company does well and where it falters. Insurance companies invariably have to deny claims at some point in time and disgruntled customers will complain. That's natural – but course correcting is important.</p>\n<p>We work hard to provide the best possible experience and to address issues as soon as they come up. Our <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews </a>tend to be overwhelmingly positive, with policyholders citing our professionalism and no-pressure sales approach when providing quotes. While we're a younger company than Tower Hill, we has nearly five times the reviews, the majority of which are positive.</p>\n<p>You can compare our average review scores to Tower Hill's in the chart below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tower%20hill%20customer%20review%20score.png?width=907&name=tower%20hill%20customer%20review%20score.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Pay attention to how a company responds to negative reviews – the silence can be telling.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"towerhillinsurancevskinonaveragepremium\">Tower Hill Insurance vs. Kin on Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Price is a major consideration when it comes to consumer satisfaction and insurance, and in Florida, that's especially true. Florida homeowners are often frustrated with their lack of insurance options and ever-increasing premiums. Many feel priced out of essential protection for their homes.</p>\n<p>Of course, insurance companies need to price policies to remain solvent, but affordability matters. That's why we constantly innovate to bring our prices down, and it shows.</p>\n<p>With an average yearly premium of $1,665 for a new Florida home worth $300,000, Tower Hill is nearly 23 percent more expensive than Kin's average of $1,354 for the same amount of coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Tower Hill</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,665</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These numbers are meant to be illustrative. Insurance premiums vary based on where you live, your home's replacement cost, your claims history, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"towerhillclaimsvskinclaims\">Tower Hill Claims vs. Kin Claims</h2>\n<p>It’s a common question: what’s the point of having insurance if it doesn’t cover you when you file a claim? While every insurance policy has exclusions, some carriers seek loopholes that make the claims process more difficult. This is often the top issue that prompts customers to leave negative reviews.</p>\n<p>Some Tower Hill reviews do cite a poor claims experiences, but ultimately, there's not enough public data to support meaningful trends.</p>\n<p>We can say this: we know how disappointing it can be to have a claim denied, and we don’t want to keep customers guessing when a big storm comes. This is why we make it a point to <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">get in touch with policyholders immediately after a storm</a>. Our goal is to be helpful before you even need us.</p>\n<p>We also use virtual inspections to streamline the claims process, but our customers get personalized, human service throughout their claim. We even pair homeowners with professional contractors through our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to get repairs done quickly and professionally. All contractors are thoroughly vetted, licensed, insured, and local.</p>\n<p>Want a better homeowners insurance experience?

We'll take a look at this company's customer reviews, average premiums, and more. That way, you can see for yourself which is truly the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance company </a>in Florida.</p>\n<p>Universal North America states it has three core values: listen, aim high, and lead by example. It maintains a B++ AM Best Rating and an A rating from Demotech with 0.77 percent of the Florida homeowners insurance market share. The company offers homeowners, flood, renters, condo, equipment protection, and earthquake insurance along with some commercial insurance policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"universalnorthamericacustomerreviews\">Universal North America Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Universal North America is easy to get confused with other insurance companies – many have similar names. So when searching for reviews online, be mindful! BBB complaints cite mishandled claims – customers say they had to call multiple times to report the claim. There are also some complaints about billing issues. The company so far has not responded to complaints.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Kin has more than 750 <a href=\"/reviews/\">customer reviews</a> on Trustpilot with an average rating of 4.8. Our customers appreciate and cite our professional and knowledgeable team, the easy of getting insured, and saving money. When we do get negative feedback, we are quick to respond and find a solution.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/universal%20north%20america%20review.png?width=907&name=universal%20north%20america%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line: Things don’t always go right, but how a company handles miscommunications and claims issues says a lot about its integrity.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"universalnorthamericaaveragepremium\">UniversalNorth America Average Premium</h2>\n<p>Thanks to more frequent and more devastating hurricanes each year, Floridians face some of the <a href=\"/blog/why-is-home-insurance-expensive-in-florida/\">highest insurance premiums</a> in the country. And the costs keep rising as storms become more frequent and severe.</p>\n<p>That makes saving on home insurance essential. For a newly constructed home valued at $300,000, the Universal North America average premium is $1,484 – <strong>10 percent higher</strong> than Kin’s average of $1,354 for the same home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Universal Insurance Company of North America</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,484</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Homeowners insurance premiums are unique to the home, so while averages are a helpful reference point, they are illustrative only. Prices vary depending on your home's location, size, construction, and more – including what coverages are (or aren't) offered. So you know: all Kin prices include <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"universalnorthamericaclaims\">Universal North America Claims</h2>\n<p>Customers expect an insurance company to handle claims in a fair and fast manner. Failing at claims is failing as an insurance company.</p>\n<p>We don’t have much visibility into how Universal North America handles claims. Some public complaints offer a glimpse, though.</p>\n<p>We can talk at length about how we make claims fast and fair, but we'll keep it short and sweet. We understand the importance of checking in with customers, both before and after a loss. We keep our policyholders informed through the claims process, and we rely on technology (like virtual inspections) to settle claims quickly and accurately.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we pair our customers with local and licensed tradesmen through our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> to ensure repairs get done quickly and professionally.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Kin can help you get more coverage for less. <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Get a quote</a> today.</p>\n<h3 id=\"homeinsurancecompanyreviews\">Home Insurance Company Reviews</h3>\n<p>Get a better look at how Kin compares to other Florida home insurance companies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/universal-property-casualty-insurance-review/\">Universal Property & Casualty Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/tower-hill-insurance-review/\">Tower Hill Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/florida-peninsula-insurance-review/\">Florida Peninsula Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/heritage-insurance-review/\">Heritage Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/upc-insurance-review/\">UPC Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/st-johns-insurance-review/\">St. Johns Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/american-integrity-insurance-review/\">American Integrity Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/peoples-trust-insurance-review/\">People's Trust Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/american-traditions-insurance-review/\">American Traditions Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/florida-family-insurance-review/\">Florida Family Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/southern-fidelity-insurance-review/\">Southern Fidelity Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/southern-oak-insurance-review/\">Southern Oak Insurance Review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/homeowners-choice-insurance-review/\">Homeowners Choice Insurance Review</a></li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"universalpropertycasualtyinsurancereviewwhattheconsumerdatasays\">Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Review: What the Consumer Data Says</h2>\n<p>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance is a Florida-based insurance carrier with moderate customer reviews and rates. Founded in 1997, it now serves 18 states. In Florida, the company has approximately 9.7 percent of the homeowners insurance market share, and it sells home insurance through agencies and direct to consumer.</p>\n<p>This Universal Property and Casualty review will use consumer data, including customer reviews, to gauge whether it's the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance company</a> for serving Florida homeowners. We will compare the data directly to Kin so you can see how each company measures up on the most important metric: customer satisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"universalpropertycasualtyinsurancevskinoncustomerreviews\">Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance vs. Kin on Customer Reviews</h2>\n<p>Universal Property and Casualty Insurance's Google reviews average 3.6 out of 5. As you can guess based on that score, the reviews are mixed: some folks are content and others are unhappy. After reading the reviews, some trends start to emerge.</p>\n<p>The five-star <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=google+reviews+universal+property+and+casualty+insurance&rlz=1C5AVSZ_enUS606US610&oq=google+reviews+universal+property+and+casualty+insurance&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.9079j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x88d903db4304e60f:0x6bdf48a408efc85c,1,,,\">Google reviews</a> point out individual representatives who were “kind and considerate” to work with. The one-star reviews tend to cite issues with claims. The negative reviews report a lack of communication and slow claims processing. One review reported a water leak claim had been open for 90 days and it still wasn't settled.</p>\n<p>Reviews in response to Hurricane Irma are mixed, too. In total, more than half of the 35 reviews that cited the hurricane were critical of the claims experience.</p>\n<p>By contrast, <a href=\"/reviews/\">Kin's customer reviews</a> average 4.8 out of 5 on Trustpilot. Customers tend to overwhelmingly cite our team's expertise and the ease with which they got insured. Like other insurance companies, our reviews note specific agents folks worked with and how pleasant and professional they were. One reviewer even noted we beat the competition’s price by $500 and increased their coverage in doing so.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the average customer review scores for Kin vs. Universal Property and Casualty:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/up%26c%20customer%20review.png?width=910&name=up%26c%20customer%20review.png\" alt=\"\" /><strong>Bottom line: Universal Property and Casualty offers a mixed claims experience for many customers.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"universalpropertycasualtyinsurancevskinonaveragepremium\">Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance vs. Kin on Average Premium</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">cost of homeowners insurance</a> is always a big consideration when choosing a home insurance company. You don't want to overpay for coverage, but you also don't want to underinsure your home.</p>\n<p>Price is where we tend to really outshine competitors like Universal Property and Casualty. Our average premium is $1,354; theirs is $1,932 to insure the same type of home. In other words, their average premium is 42 percent higher.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium</th>\n<th>UP&amp;C Average Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,932</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Keep in mind that not every homeowner insured by Kin will pay $1,354 in annual premium. Homeowners premiums vary based on location, house size, construction, claims history, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"universalpropertycasualtyinsuranceonclaims\">Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance on Claims</h2>\n<p>A homeowners insurance policy should prove its value when you have to file a <a href=\"/claims/\">claim</a>. Many Florida homeowners are often left disappointed when they actually need their coverage to help them recover after devastating hurricanes and floods. Customer reviews can offer a glimpse at what to expect from an insurance company's claims experience.</p>\n<p>Universal Property and Casualty has very polarized claims reviews, suggesting that the claims experience is contingent on the claims representative or how busy the claims department is.</p>\n<p>We understand that speed and communication matter when handling a claim. That's why we use technology to streamline claims processing to make sure your claim is settled quickly, fairly, and easily. Our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network </a>ensures you are paired with licensed, insured, local contractors to get repair work done professionally and fast.</p>\n<p>We also <a href=\"/blog/move-fast-and-fix-things/\">get in touch with our customers after a storm</a>.

About 30 percent of customers give UPC excellent ratings and 39 percent rated them poor.

The company states it has over 150 years of insurance experience and closed 95 percent of Hurricane Sandy claims (1,500) within two months.

That damage is not cheap to repair, and policies are priced accordingly.</p>\n<p>However, some companies are working hard to bring prices down, and it seems both Kin and US Coastal are on the right track. Based on a $300,000 newly built home, US Coastal's average yearly premium is $1,982, about 46 percent higher than Kin's at $1,354.</p>\n<p>However, these averages aren't set in stone. You need to get a quote to know how much you'll pay for home insurance. That's the only way to accurately price your risk based on your location, your home's age and construction, and more. You may also be eligible for the additional <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageannualpremiumforaspandataa11ynumberd300kspannewlybuilthome\">Average Annual Premium for a <span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> Newly Built Home</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>US Coastal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Florida</td>\n<td>$1,354</td>\n<td>$1,982</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"uscoastalinsuranceclaims\">US Coastal Insurance Claims</h2>\n<p>It’s hard to determine much about the US Coastal claims process based on one review. There's not enough visibility into the process for us to analyze.</p>\n<p>But we can talk about Kin's claims process. We rely on communication, transparency, and technology to make claims as easy as possible. We understand there's nothing more stressful than uncertainty coupled with a loss. So we keep policyholders in the loop as their claim moves along, and we use virtual inspections and other digital tools to assess damage quickly and fairly.</p>\n<p>To help our homeowners get their damage repaired fast, we created the <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a>. This allows policyholders to connect with and choose from local and licensed contractors to handle their repairs.</p>\n<p>Thinking about making the switch to Kin?
